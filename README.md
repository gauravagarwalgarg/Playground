Playground
==========

> This repository is a collection of programs that are developed for learning by addin explanation, possible use cases, links to further readings/applications and best coding practices.

It is a **playground** because it is an expertimental platform where the findings gets captured and logged. Basically, all the proof of concepts resides here and later converted to proper applications if it matures enough.


## It will contain:
- Findings from different practice programs which can be converted into some use case applications
- Best coding practices and standards followed
- Cheatsheet for learning
- Bring in doxygen based documentation
- Installation guidelines

## How to Use This Repository
**TODO** TBD
